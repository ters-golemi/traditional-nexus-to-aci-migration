# Traditional Nexus to ACI Migration

## Overview

This repository provides comprehensive documentation and procedures for migrating from a traditional Cisco Nexus data center network to Cisco's Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) solution.

## Migration Scenario

The migration guide in this repository addresses a data center environment with the following characteristics:

- **6 Nexus Switches**: 2 core, 2 aggregation, and 2 access switches
- **vPC Configuration**: Between core and aggregation layers
- **20 VLANs**: Supporting various applications and management networks
- **Connected Workloads**: Physical servers and VMware ESXi hosts
- **Migration Approach**: Parallel deployment with phased cutover to minimize downtime

## Documentation

### ðŸ“˜ [Complete Migration Guide](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)

The comprehensive migration guide includes:

- **Current Environment Assessment**: Documentation and inventory procedures
- **Prerequisites**: Hardware, software, and planning requirements
- **ACI Architecture Overview**: Understanding the target architecture
- **Planning Phase**: Design decisions and preparation (5 weeks)
- **Migration Procedure**: Step-by-step migration process (30 days)
  - Day 1: ACI fabric preparation
  - Day 2-4: Pilot migration
  - Day 5-10: Bulk migration
  - Day 11-30: Full transition and optimization
- **Validation and Testing**: Pre and post-migration validation procedures
- **Rollback Procedures**: Risk mitigation and rollback strategies
- **Post-Migration Tasks**: Optimization and operational procedures
- **Best Practices**: Design, operational, and security recommendations
- **References**: Links to Cisco documentation, training, and tools

## Key Features

âœ… **Cisco Validated Designs**: Follows Cisco best practices and validated designs  
âœ… **Zero-Downtime Goal**: Parallel deployment minimizes service disruption  
âœ… **Phased Approach**: Gradual migration with validation at each stage  
âœ… **Rollback Procedures**: Clear rollback strategies for risk mitigation  
âœ… **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed procedures, checklists, and templates  

## Quick Start

1. **Review the [Migration Guide](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)** to understand the complete process
2. **Complete Pre-Migration Assessment** (see Appendix A checklist)
3. **Plan Your Design** (Week 1-2 of planning phase)
4. **Lab Validation** (Week 3-4 of planning phase)
5. **Execute Migration** (Follow the phased approach)

## Migration Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Assessment & Design | 2 weeks | Network documentation, ACI design |
| Lab Validation | 2 weeks | Build lab, test procedures |
| Production Prep | 1 week | Deploy ACI fabric, base configuration |
| Pilot Migration | 2 days | Migrate non-critical workload |
| Bulk Migration | 1 week | Migrate all workloads in batches |
| Optimization | 1 week | Fine-tune and optimize |
| Decommission | 2 weeks | Remove legacy infrastructure |

## Target Architecture

The migration transforms the traditional three-tier Nexus architecture into an ACI fabric:

**From (Traditional Nexus):**
```
Core Layer (2x Nexus) - L3 Routing
    â†• vPC
Aggregation Layer (2x Nexus)
    â†•
Access Layer (2x Nexus) â†’ Servers/ESXi
```

**To (ACI):**
```
APIC Cluster (3x Controllers)
    â†“ Management
Spine Layer (2+ Spines) - ECMP Fabric
    â†• Full Mesh
Leaf Layer (2+ Leafs) â†’ Servers/ESXi
```

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration, ensure you have:

- **Hardware**: 3x APIC controllers, 2+ Spine switches, 2+ Leaf switches
- **Skills**: Team trained on ACI fundamentals and operations
- **Documentation**: Complete inventory of current Nexus environment
- **Approvals**: Change management approval for migration activities
- **Backup**: Full configuration backups of all Nexus switches
